Instructions for mdn tasks

Objects basics 1

In this task you are provided with an object literal, and your tasks are to

- Store the value of the name property inside the catName variable, using bracket notation.
- Run the greeting() method using dot notation (it will log the greeting to the browser's console).
- Update the color property value to black.
- Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

In our next task, we want you to have a go at creating your own object literal to represent one of your favorite bands. The required properties are:

- name: A string representing the band name.
- nationality: A string representing the country the band comes from.
- genre: What type of music the band plays.
- members: A number representing the number of members the band has.
- formed: A number representing the year the band formed.
- split: A number representing the year the band split up, or false if they are still together.
- albums: An array representing the albums released by the band. Each array item should be an object containing the following members:
  name: A string representing the name of the album.
  released: A number representing the year the album was released.
- Include at least two albums in the albums array.

Once you've done this, you should then write a string to the variable bandInfo, which will contain a small biography detailing their name, nationality, years active, and style, and the title and release date of their first album.

Object basics 3

In this task, we want you to return to the cat object literal from Task 1. We want you to rewrite the greeting() method so that it logs "Hello, said Bertie the Cymric." to the browser's console, but in a way that will work across any cat object of the same structure, regardless of its name or breed.

When you are done, write your own object called cat2, which has the same structure, exactly the same greeting() method, but a different name, breed, and color.

Call both greeting() methods to check that they log appropriate greetings to the console.

In the code you wrote for Task 3, the greeting() method is defined twice, once for each cat. This isn't ideal (specifically, it violates a principle in programming sometimes called DRY or "Don't Repeat Yourself").

In this task we want you to improve the code so greeting() is only defined once, and every cat instance gets its own greeting() method. Hint: you should use a JavaScript constructor to create cat instances.
