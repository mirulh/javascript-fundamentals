<!-- This code snippet demonstrates the use of the map function in JavaScript to transform the elements of an array. Let's break down the code step by step:

The toUpper function is defined. This function takes a single parameter, which is a string, and returns the uppercase version of that string using the toUpperCase() method.

An array named cats is defined, containing several strings representing different cat species.

The map function is called on the cats array. The map function is used to create a new array by applying a provided function to each element of the original array. In this case, the provided function is toUpper, which converts a string to uppercase.

The result of the map operation is stored in the upperCats variable. This new array contains the uppercase versions of the cat species names, transformed using the toUpper function.

Finally, the console.log statement is used to print out the upperCats array, which contains the uppercase names of the cat species.

When the code is executed, you will see the following output:

Copy code
[ "LEOPARD", "SERVAL", "JAGUAR", "TIGER", "CARACAL", "LION" ]
In summary, the map function is a powerful array method that iterates over each element in an array, applies a provided function to each element, and creates a new array containing the results of applying that function to each element. In this code, it was used to convert each cat species name to uppercase using the toUpper function. -->
