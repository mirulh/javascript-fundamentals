Array methods
Arrays provide a lot of methods. To make things easier, in this chapter they are split into groups.

Add/remove items
We already know methods that add and remove items from the beginning or the end:

arr.push(...items) – adds items to the end,
arr.pop() – extracts an item from the end,
arr.shift() – extracts an item from the beginning,
arr.unshift(...items) – adds items to the beginning.
