JavaScript array methods can be categorized into two groups based on their behavior: those that return a new array and those that mutate the original array. Here's a list of some commonly used methods for each category:

Return New Array:

- map(): Creates a new array by applying a given function to each element of the original array.

- filter(): Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test defined by a provided function.

- concat(): Combines two or more arrays and returns a new array without modifying the original arrays.

- slice(): Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array, specified by beginning and ending indices.

Mutate Original Array:

- push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and modifies the original array.

- pop(): Removes the last element from an array and modifies the original array.

- shift(): Removes the first element from an array and modifies the original array.

- unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and modifies the original array.

- splice(): Adds or removes elements from an array at a specified index and modifies the original array.

- reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in an array and modifies the original array.

- sort(): Sorts the elements of an array in place and modifies the original array.

These are some of the most commonly used methods in each category. Keep in mind that there are other array methods available in JavaScript, but these are the ones that specifically fit your criteria of either returning a new array or mutating the original array.
