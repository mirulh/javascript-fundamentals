<!-- Problem assessment

- Problem statement: You have an array of user objects, each one has user.name. Write the code that converts it into an array of names.
    
    -- let john = {name: "John", age: 25} <- this is user objects
    -- name: John                         <- this is user.name
    -- [John, Pete, Mary]                 <- this is array of names
    
 -->

<!-- steps to solve the problem 

- create function names that uses array users that contains several objects

- use method map to retrieve item.name from the objects. Map method creates a new array from results of calling func for every element.

<!-- Array method used 
  
map()
